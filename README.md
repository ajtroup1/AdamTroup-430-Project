# GoDoc

Automatic documentation generator for Go. Leave GoDoc comment blocks throughout your code and have GoDoc generate a documentation for you!

GoDoc reads specially formatted comments to save information about your project for generating your doc.


**Signify a comment is meant for GoDoc by using three asterisks (`/***`) at the start of the comment block instead of a single asterisk (`/*`).**

- **GoDoc comment:**
  ```go
  /*** <---
      -- FILE
      @file myfile.go
      @description My description
      ...
  */
  ```
- **Regular multi-line comment in Go:**
  ```go
    /* <---
        This is my comment
        It has multiple lines
    */
  ```

Reserved comment keywords, or tags, are prefixed with `@`, similar to Doxygen.

At the top of your comment block, start with `-- TYPE`, where `TYPE` is the type of comments you're making.

- Example: If you are making a block of file-level comments, put `-- FILE` at the top of your comment block.

GoDoc gives you shorter options for identifiers, since writing 'dependency' over and over again is infurating. For example:

- `-- PACKAGE` & `-- PKG` are evaluated the same
- `@dep` & `@dependency` are evaluated the same
- Even `@package` & `@name` are evaluated the same within package comment blocks
- Look at the information on types of comments for more information on these shorthand options

## Types of GoDoc comment blocks:

\*Some identifiers have options for shorthand tag names. If you want verbose comments in your source, use the full tag names, but it will not affect the generation of documentation if you use shorthands.

## How does GoDoc work?
GoDoc parses your formatted source comments into a data structure of 'nodes':

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="./test/Design/DummyDataStructure.png" style="width: 75vw;"/>
</div>

*Note: This tree isn't fully comprehensive (for easy readability) and each 'node' in the tree contains metadata.

Then, this data structure is easily traversed to generate markdown. This works exactly like a compiler, but with only comments.
